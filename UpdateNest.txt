[languageCode:en_US] 

version: 2026.1.22
1. New WSNest-6 high-utilization nesting algorithm
   - Sixth-generation intelligent nesting algorithm with significantly higher utilization than previous versions
   - Substantially improved panel utilization, helping users save material costs
   - Seamless upgrade from previous algorithms, available immediately after software update
   - Maximum optimization quantity for Basic Edition increased from 5,000 to 8,000
2. Simplified algorithm modules, retaining only high-speed algorithm WSNest-2 and high-utilization algorithm WSNest-6, removed JRE runtime dependency, reducing software size by 165MB after extraction
3. Further improved [Excitech Auto Labeling (VU)] format file output to support rotated labels
4. Added new equipment vendor support (Filato, Beaver, WoodTec, HuaHua)
5. Improved new version detection, supporting automatic new version checking and navigation to the download page
6. Further improved [Maintenance Period] verification functionality
7. Added Uzbek translation, Ukrainian translation and improved multi-language translations for multiple interfaces
8. Others
(1) Changed exported image format from BMP to PNG for smaller file sizes
(2) Improved callback progress display for multi-batch optimization
(3) Fixed the issue where label position calculation did not meet expectations when performing "Post-Processing Optimization" on a single large panel while "Real-time update panel position" is enabled
(4) Fixed the issue where data source type collection strings did not match expectations
(5) Further improved the logic for "NC generation when arc radius is less than or equal to tool radius in free-form pocket milling contour paths"
(6) "MPR Tool Number Description" file now supports multi-language output
(7) Optimized other details ...
